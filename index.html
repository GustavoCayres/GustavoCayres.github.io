    <!-- Experience Summary -->

    <!-- <section>
        After graduating in Computer Science at the University of SÃ£o Paulo, I have taken part in academic research, volunteer work and startups of various segments. With 4 years of work experience in software development and project leadership, I've acquired
        great expertise in various languages (including Python, Javascript and SQL), relational databases and development with Agile methodologies. Through this journey, I have met many amazing professionals, learned a lot and lead various successful
        projects, from small experiments to large products serving hundreds of companies. I work hard to always do my best, guaranteeing that I and everyone around me are committed to our mission, and are responsible for its successes and failures.
